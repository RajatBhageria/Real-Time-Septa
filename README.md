Real Time SeptaDescription and Work Breakdown: An app that creates a virtual graph representation of the SEPTA system and combines it with the SEPTA API to provide useful tools for travelers. • We created a data scraper to turn the SEPTA map into actionable data, byscraping the station list from each of the SEPTA schedules. (Matt)• After that, we used a map reduce algorithm to take that data and create anadjacency list of the SEPTA map graph. (Matt)• Using the adjacency list of the SEPTA map, we created a shortest distanceroute calculator using breadth first search. (Rajat)• We used the SEPTA API, Google Maps API, created KML XML files of SEPTAtracks, and created a real time map of the location of all the SEPTA trains. (Colin, Matt, and Rajat)• We used location data, the SEPTA API, and a JSONp scraper to tell the userwhen the next train would arrive at the station they were at. (Colin)• Taking the SEPTA map graph adjacency list, we also used the page rankalgorithm to see which station(s) were the most influential in the system.
